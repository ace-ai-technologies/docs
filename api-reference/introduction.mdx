## Welcome to the Ace API

The Ace AI API allows developers to interact with AI agents and related services to fine-tune models, generate synthetic data, clean datasets, and more. This API is designed to handle client requests efficiently and communicate with backend services via Kafka for scalable and decoupled processing.

With this API, you can:
- Fine-tune AI agents using datasets.
- Request agents to generate synthetic data.
- Access and manage datasets with signed URLs.
- Leverage AI capabilities for custom tasks.

## Core Functionality

The Ace AI API is organized into several key sections:
1. **Agent Management**: Fine-tune agents and request synthetic data generation.
2. **Synthetic Data Management**: Upload/download datasets, clean data, and generate synthetic data.
3. **Data Refinery**: Placeholder for data preprocessing and management tasks.
4. **General AI (GenAI)**: Placeholder for general AI-related capabilities.

Each section is modular and extensible, with additional endpoints planned for future updates.

## Authentication
Coming Soon.

## Base Endpoints

| Route                | Method | Description                                         |
|----------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `/`                  | GET    | Default route. Returns "hello world!" as a health check. |
| `/agent/fineTune`    | POST   | Fine-tunes an AI agent with a given dataset.        |
| `/agent/produceSyntheticData` | GET    | Requests synthetic data generation from an agent. |

For detailed documentation of each endpoint, refer to the specific API reference pages.

This introduction provides an overview of the API, its key functionalities, and a quick reference for getting started. Let me know if you'd like to add anything or move to documenting specific endpoints!

## Welcome to the Ace API

The Ace AI API allows developers to interact with AI-related services to:
- Generate synthetic data.
- Upload and download datasets using signed URLs.
- Evaluate datasets with custom AI prompts.
- (Planned) Perform data refinement and other advanced data tasks.

These services are designed to handle client requests efficiently. Additionally, the API can communicate with backend services (including Kafka) for scalable and decoupled processing of tasks like data generation and model training.

## Core Functionality

The Ace AI API is organized into several key sections:
1. **Authentication**: Securely log in to obtain session tokens.
2. **Synthetic Data**: Upload datasets, request synthetic data generation, and download results.
3. **Generative AI (GenAI)**: Upload datasets for AI tasks, and evaluate them using custom prompts.
4. **Data Refinery**: *(Coming Soon!)* A placeholder for data preprocessing and management tasks.

## Authentication

The `/auth/v1/login` endpoint handles user login and returns a session token (as a cookie and via Bearer token) that is required for accessing protected endpoints.

## Base Endpoints

Below is a quick list of the core API endpoints. For complete details, please refer to the **Endpoints** section in this documentation.

| Route                           | Method | Description                                                                |
|---------------------------------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/`                             | GET    | Default route. Returns "hello world!" as a simple health check.            |
| `/auth/v1/login`               | POST   | Authenticates a user; on success returns/sets a session token.             |
| `/synthetic/v1/uploadURL`      | GET    | Generates a signed URL for securely uploading datasets.                    |
| `/synthetic/v1/downloadURL`    | GET    | Generates a signed URL for securely downloading generated or stored data.  |
| `/synthetic/v1/generate`       | POST   | Requests the creation of synthetic data based on an existing dataset.      |
| `/genAI/v1/uploadURL`          | GET    | Generates a signed URL to upload data for GenAI tasks.                     |
| `/genAI/v1/downloadURL`        | GET    | Generates a signed URL to download data used or produced by GenAI tasks.   |
| `/genAI/v1/evaluate`           | POST   | Submits a custom prompt for evaluating or analyzing the uploaded dataset.  |

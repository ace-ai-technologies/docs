## Welcome to the Ace API

The Ace AI API allows developers to interact with AI-related services to:
- Generate synthetic data.
- Upload and download datasets using signed URLs.
- Perform specific tasks with custom AI prompts.
- (Planned) Perform data refinement and other advanced data tasks.

These services are designed to handle client requests efficiently. Additionally, the API can communicate with backend services (including Kafka) for scalable and decoupled processing of tasks like data generation and model training.
<Note>
All data will be subject to scrutiny from our team of domain-expert human evaluators.

## Core Functionality

The Ace AI API is organized into several key sections:
1. **Authentication**: Sign up, log in, and manage your user profile.
2. **Synthetic Data**: Upload original datasets, generate synthetic data, and download the results.
3. **Generative AI (GenAI)**: Upload data for custom AI tasks and retrieve analytical results.
4. **Evaluator**: Retrieve, create, and update evaluation data, as well as manage comments on evaluation entries.
5. **Editor**: Retrieve, create, and update editing tasks for enhanced data processing.
{/* 6. **Data Refinery**: *(Coming Soon!)* A placeholder for advanced data preprocessing and management. */}


## Authentication

Authentication is the foundation of our API. The following endpoints help you register, log in, and manage your profile:
- **POST `/auth/v1/signup`**: Register a new user account.
- **POST `/auth/v1/login`**: Log in and receive a session token (returned as both an HttpOnly cookie and a Bearer token).
- **PATCH `/auth/v1/profile/{username}`**: Update your user profile with expertise, bio, education, and experiences.

## Base Endpoints

Below is a quick list of the core API endpoints. For complete details—including request parameters, response formats, and usage examples—please refer to the dedicated pages in the **Endpoints** section.
